# Spring Boot Message Queue Listener - Single File Prompt

Create a single Java file implementing a Spring Boot application that listens to both JMS (ActiveMQ) and AMQP (RabbitMQ) queues. The solution must:

- Use Spring Boot 3.x, Java 17+, and Maven.
- Contain all configuration and listener logic in one file (`MessageQueueListenerApplication.java`).
- Support both @JmsListener and @RabbitListener methods for message processing.
- Use @Value for property injection and @Bean methods for all configuration.
- Include error handling, logging, and retry logic in listener methods.
- Use static inner classes for message payloads and validation.
- Demonstrate event-driven architecture and best practices.
- Be production-ready, readable, and well-organized.

Deliverables:
- Single Java file with all logic and configuration.
- application.yml and pom.xml for configuration and dependencies.
- Basic integration test to verify context and bean setup.

Keep the implementation concise, clear, and maintainable.
